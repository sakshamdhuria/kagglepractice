# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

#reading the data:
train_data = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv")
test_data = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/titanic/test.csv")

#imporoting the model we wanna use so here is the random forest one 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

#defining our output and inputs 
y_train = train_data["Survived"]
features = [ "Pclass", "Sex", "SibSp", "Parch" ]
X_train=pd.get_dummies(train_data[features])
X_test=pd.get_dummies(test_data[features])

#training the model 
titanic_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=1)
titanic_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#predictions on tester:
y_test = titanic_model.predict(X_test)


#creating the file to submit
output = pd.DataFrame({'PassengerId': test_data.PassengerId, 'Survived': y_test})
output.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
print("done and submitted xd")
